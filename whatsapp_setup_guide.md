# WhatsApp Setup Guide for ShopMate

## Current Issue
Your Twilio phone number `+13157131686` is not configured for WhatsApp messaging. You need to set up the WhatsApp Sandbox.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Access Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox
- Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/try-it-out/whatsapp-learn
- Or navigate: Twilio Console → Messaging → Try it out → Send a WhatsApp message

### 2. Join the Sandbox
- You'll see a sandbox number (usually `+14155238886`)
- You'll see a sandbox keyword (like "join <keyword>")
- Send this message from your phone to the sandbox number

### 3. Update Environment Variable
After joining the sandbox, update your `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` to the sandbox number:
- Should be: `+14155238886` ✅ (or whatever sandbox number Twilio shows)

### 4. Test Configuration
Once updated, the WhatsApp notifications should work properly.

## Alternative Solution
If you want to use your own number for WhatsApp:
1. You need a Twilio approved WhatsApp Business Account
2. This requires business verification and can take several days
3. For testing, the sandbox is the quickest option

## Current Status
- ✅ Email notifications working
- ⚠️ WhatsApp needs sandbox setup
- ✅ App continues working even if WhatsApp fails
